        <p>
            Thank you for visitig my portfolio! This site is all about me and my accomplishments.
            The first page you will come across is my about me page. This includes my resume (for my skills)
            as well as my contact information and a picture of me. Next, you will see my courses page. This page 
            includes all of the courses I am taking at UL this semester as well as my top favorite courses I have
            taken at my homme univerisity of University of South Carolina. Next, you will see my employement page that
            includes the three jobs I have had (all real!). Finally you will move onto my portfolio. The first one I 
            selected was the biggest programming assignment I have every completed. It is probaly the project I am most 
            proud of. Next is my digital portfolio from high school. This was the biggest website I have ever made and
            I thought it was fitting to include this in my updated portfolio. Finally, you will see my favorite lab from 
            this class (CS4082) which is a JavaScript assignment.

            As I mentioned before, I have made a website portfolio before. I really liked the font and overall design of my 
            original one, so this project is heavily inspired by it. That being said, I did not take any HTML or CSS code from anything
            that was not my own past work.  <br>
            However, I did use infromation found on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14226803/wait-5-seconds-before-executing-next-line
            to get my delay working for the suprise me button. 
           
            <br>
            Javascript Functions: <br>
            setCookie(cname, cvalue, exDays) - sets a cookie with the given parameters (taken from CS4082 Lab Week 08)<br>
            getCookie(cname) - returns the cookie with the given name (taken from CS4082 Lab Week 08)<br>
            checkCookies() - onload function that checks if cookies are set yet (taken from CS4082 Lab Week 08 and edited)<br>
            rollOver(choice) - this was used for showing the paragraph that I have typed out for each portfolio piece. 
            The choice is either 1, 2, or 3 and depending on which one we have certain divs will get replaced with paragraphs
            or disapear entirely <br>
            save() - this was used to save the text that disappears or is written over in the rollOver() so I can rewrite it when 
            the mouse goes off of it. <br>
            mouseOut() - this uses the variables stored in the save() function to restore the original look of the divs after
            the mouse rolls out of an image of a portfolio piece. <br>
            surpiseMe() - this function will select a random one of my webpages to display for 30 seconds. It will then selected
            another random one to show and will do this until the user stops it. <br>
            week8-5.js contains all functions provided to us (with the edits I had to make per the assignment requirements.)
